;; (SHARED) EVENT CHANNELS

;; The way to get a channel that takes a single event that can be consumed
;; by multiple parties is to use tap / mult.
;; map / table / chart view event-channels are created as tapped copies of
;; `event-chan` (get a new own by calling `(event-tap)`).
;; Any event that is put onto the shared `event-chan` is copied onto all taps.
;; Taps can each also have local events that a given view both puts and takes.
